Space optimization using bit manipulations
There are many situations where we use integer values as index in array to see presence or absence, we can use bit manipulations to optimize space in such problems.
Let us consider below problem as an example.
Given two numbers say a and b, mark the multiples of 2 and 5 between a and b using less than O(|b â€“ a|) space and output each of the multiples. 

Note : We have to mark the multiples i.e save (key, value) pairs in memory such that each key either have value as 1 or 0 representing as multiple of 2 or 5 or not respectively. 

Examples :  

Input : 2 10
Output : 2 4 5 6 8 10

Input: 60 95
Output: 60 62 64 65 66 68 70 72 74 75 76 78 
        80 82 84 85 86 88 90 92 94 95
