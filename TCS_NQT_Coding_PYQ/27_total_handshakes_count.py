Given the fact that any two persons shake hand exactly once, Can you tell the total count of handshakes happened in that meeting? 
Input Format : 

The first line contains the number of test cases T, T lines follow.  

Each line then contains an integer N, the total number of people attended that meeting. 

Output Format : 

Print the number of handshakes for each test-case in a new line. 

Constraints : 

1 <= T <= 1000  
0 < N < 106
