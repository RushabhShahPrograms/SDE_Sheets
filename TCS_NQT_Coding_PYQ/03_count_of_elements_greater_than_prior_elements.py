'''
Given an integer array Arr of size N the task is to find the count of elements whose value is greater than all of its prior elements.

Note : 1st element of the array should be considered in the count of the result.

For example,
Arr[]={7,4,8,2,9}
As 7 is the first element, it will consider in the result.
8 and 9 are also the elements that are greater than all of its previous elements.
Since total of  3 elements is present in the array that meets the condition.
Hence the output = 3.
Example 1:

Input 
5 -> Value of N, represents size of Arr
7-> Value of Arr[0]
4 -> Value of Arr[1]
8-> Value of Arr[2]
2-> Value of Arr[3]
9-> Value of Arr[4]

Output :
3

Example 2:
5   -> Value of N, represents size of Arr
3  -> Value of Arr[0]
4 -> Value of Arr[1]
5 -> Value of Arr[2]
8 -> Value of Arr[3]
9 -> Value of Arr[4]

Output : 
5

Constraints

1<=N<=20
1<=Arr[i]<=10000
