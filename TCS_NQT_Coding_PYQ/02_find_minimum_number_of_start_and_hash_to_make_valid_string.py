'''
Problem Statement – Given a string S(input consisting) of ‘*’ and ‘#’. The length of the string is variable. The task is to find the minimum number of ‘*’ or ‘#’ to make it a valid string. The string is considered valid if the number of ‘*’ and ‘#’ are equal. The ‘*’ and ‘#’ can be at any position in the string.
Note : The output will be a positive or negative integer based on number of ‘*’ and ‘#’ in the input string.

(*>#): positive integer
(#>*): negative integer
(#=*): 0
Example 1:
Input 1:

###***   -> Value of S
Output :

0   → number of * and # are equal
'''

s = input("Enter the string: ")
a=b=0

for i in s:
    if i=="*":
        a+=1
    elif i=="#":
        b+=1
print(a-b)
